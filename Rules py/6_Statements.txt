Statements
Describes various parts of the Python language. 
Command or Calculation. 

Conditional Statements
block1
    block2
        block3
        block4
    block5 
block6 

So we got

Arithmetic
+   -   *   /   %   //  **

Comparison 
==  !=  >   <   >=  <=

Logical
and or  not

Conditional Statements 
if this;
    do('that')
otherwise: 
    do('something else')

Statements in pseudocode
if(expression) then: 
    code_area_1
else: 
    code_area_2

You can put mutliple conditional Statements 
in one program. 

Nesting 
d = 10 
e = 11
if d == 10: 
    if e == 11: 
        print('d is 10 and e is 11')

2 types of Statements in PYthon 
1). Simple Statements
    print('A simple statment.')

2). Compound Statements
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print('y is even.')
    else:
    print('y is odd.')
else if statments are an example of compound Statements.
